Simulated Delivery Project - Academy Oct 2022

Problem
As the government works to improve building safety, there is currently no central system that allows public services to easily identify buildings. Frequently, the critical information such as proprietary details are run in excel and held on individual laptops. This leads to errors, duplication, inconsistency and inaccuracy. 

Our job is to build a clean central report system to display available information to government data custodians. In turn, this should encourage everyone to use the central system, improving efficiency and providing consistent and accurate data across public services.

Aim 
Our system will pull information from the Ordnance Survey (OS) API and return information based on key parameters related to building safety (building height, building use, and Unique Property Reference Number). The report will provide information on properties based on the location provided.
